1: Should we really care for the greatest actors of the past could we have them before us? Should we find them too different from our accent of thought, of feeling, of speech, in a thousand minute particulars which are of the essence of all three? Dr. Doran's long and interesting records of the triumphs of Garrick, and other less familiar, but in their day hardly less astonishing, players, do not relieve one of the doubt. Garrick himself, as sometimes happens with people who have been the subject of much anecdote and other conversation, here as elsewhere, bears no very distinct figure. One hardly sees the wood for the trees. On the other hand, the account of Betterton, "perhaps the greatest of English actors," is delightfully fresh. That intimate friend of Dryden, Tillatson, Pope, who executed a copy of the actor's portrait by Kneller which is still extant, was worthy of their friendship; his career brings out the best elements in stage life. The stage in these volumes presents itself indeed not merely as a mirror of life, but as an illustration of the utmost intensity of life, in the fortunes and characters of the players. Ups and downs, generosity, dark fates, the most delicate goodness, have nowhere been more prominent than in the private existence of those devoted to the public mimicry of men and women. Contact with the stage, almost throughout its history, presents itself as a kind of touchstone, to bring out the bizarrerie, the theatrical tricks and contrasts, of the actual world.

2: The first and most important rule of legitimate or popular
government, that is to say, of government whose object is the
good of the people, is therefore, as I have observed, to follow
in everything the general will. But to follow this will it is
necessary to know it, and above all to distinguish it from the
particular will, beginning with one's self: this distinction is
always very difficult to make, and only the most sublime virtue
can afford sufficient illumination for it. As, in order to will,
it is necessary to be free, a difficulty no less great than the
former arises � that of preserving at once the public liberty
and the authority of government. Look into the motives which have
induced men, once united by their common needs in a general
society, to unite themselves still more intimately by means of
civil societies: you will find no other motive than that of
assuring the property, life and liberty of each member by the
protection of all. But can men be forced to defend the liberty
of any one among them, without trespassing on that of others?
And how can they provide for the public needs, without alienating
the individual property of those who are forced to contribute to
them? With whatever sophistry all this may be covered over, it is
certain that if any constraint can be laid on my will, I am no
longer free, and that I am no longer master of my own property,
if any one else can lay a hand on it. This difficulty, which would
have seemed insurmountable, has been removed, like the first, by
the most sublime of all human institutions, or rather by a divine
inspiration, which teaches mankind to imitate here below the
unchangeable decrees of the Deity. By what inconceivable art has a
means been found of making men free by making them subject; of
using in the service of the State the properties, the persons and
even the lives of all its members, without constraining and without
consulting them; of confining their will by their own admission; of
overcoming their refusal by that consent, and forcing them to punish
themselves, when they act against their own will? How can it be that
all should obey, yet nobody take upon him to command, and that all
should serve, and yet have no masters, but be the more free, as, in
apparent subjection, each loses no part of his liberty but what might
be hurtful to that of another? These wonders are the work of law. It
is to law alone that men owe justice and liberty. It is this salutary
organ of the will of all which establishes, in civil right, the
natural equality between men. It is this celestial voice which
dictates to each citizen the precepts of public reason, and teaches
him to act according to the rules of his own judgment, and not to
behave inconsistently with himself. It is with this voice alone that
political rulers should speak when they command; for no sooner does
one man, setting aside the law, claim to subject another to his
private will, than he departs from the state of civil society, and
confronts him face to face in the pure state of nature, in which
obedience is prescribed solely by necessity.

3: The article �Shock therapy for mental patients will be reviewed�
    continues the ignorant tradition of demonizing electroconvulsive
    therapy (ECT) in the media (the very use of the anachronistic
    and misleading phrase �shock therapy� is unwarranted) without
	presenting the compelling reasons for its continued use. Most
    of the facts and quotations in the article, including the
    gratuitous final paragraph about pigs in an abattoir, are
    simply taken from an article by Davar in �Issues in Medical
    Ethics�, without questioning whether Davar�s presentation of
	the issue is an unbiased and scientifically accurate one. What
    Ms. Davar, and by extension Ms. Jain, has done is simply cite
    authorities who agree with her point of view, quote statistics
    without context, use an abundance of negative adjectives, and
    ignore outright the empirically proven benefits (often
	life-saving) of ECT in many categories of mentally-ill
    patients. This is shabby and irresponsible medical journalism.
    While this is not the place to dispute, point-by-point, Ms.
    Davar�s presentation of her position and Ms. Jain�s repetition
    of it, I would like to quote, to counter their negative
	emphasis, from Andrew Solomon�s widely read, intensively
    researched, highly respected book, The Noonday Demon: An
    Anatomy of Depression. Solomon writes: �Antidepressants
    are effective [against major depression] about 50 percent of
    the time, perhaps a bit more; ECT seems to have some
	significant impact between 75 and 90 percent of the time...
    Many patients feel substantially better within a few days
    of having an ECT treatment � a boon particularly striking
    in contrast to the long, slow process of medication response.
    ECT is particularly appropriate for the severely suicidal �
	for patients who repeatedly injure themselves and whose
    situation is therefore mortally urgent � because of its
    rapid action and high response rate, and it is used in
    pregnant women, the sick, and the elderly, because it does
    not have the systemic side effects or drug-interaction
	problems of most medications.�
	There are, indeed, problems with the administration of ECT,
    especially in a country like India with its poor health
    infrastructure. It would be foolish to deny that the
    practice is subject to abuse (as Solomon and numerous
	Indian writers report). The continued use of �direct� ECT
    (without the use of an anesthetic) is certainly a matter
    of concern � and a concerted effort to implement national
    guidelines making �modified� ECT (using an anesthetic)
    mandatory is as necessary as it is laudatory. But we can
	all do without more pieces of journalism which perpetuate
    the myth that ECT is a medically unjustified, indeed barbaric
    practice, tantamount to torture. This ignorant view, equally
    prevalent in the West as it is in India, has more to do with
    movies like One Flew Over The Cuckoo�s Nest than
    with scientific fact.

4: In regard to propaganda the early advocates of universal
    literacy and a free press envisaged only two possibilities:
    the propaganda might be true, or it might be false. They did
    not foresee what in fact has happened, above all in our
	Western capitalist democracies - the development of a vast
    mass communications industry, concerned in the main neither
    with the true nor the false, but with the unreal, the more
    or less totally irrelevant. In a word, they failed to take
    into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.
	In the past most people never got a chance of fully
    satisfying this appetite. They might long for distractions,
    but the distractions were not provided. Christmas came but
    once a year, feasts were "solemn and rare," there were few
    readers and very little to read, and the nearest approach
	to a neighborhood movie theater was the parish church, where
    the performances, though infrequent, were somewhat monotonous.
    For conditions even remotely comparable to those now prevailing
    we must return to imperial Rome, where the populace was kept
    in good humor by frequent, gratuitous doses of many kinds of
	entertainment - from poetical dramas to gladiatorial fights,
    from recitations of Virgil to all-out boxing, from concerts
    to military reviews and public executions. But even in Rome
    there was nothing like the non-stop distraction now provided
    by newspapers and magazines, by radio, television and the
	cinema. In Brave New World non-stop distractions of the most
    fascinating nature (the feelies, orgy-porgy, centrifugal
    bumblepuppy) are deliberately used as instruments of policy,
    for the purpose of preventing people from paying too much
    attention to the realities of the social and political
	situation. The other world of religion is different from
    the other world of entertainment; but they resemble one
    another in being most decidedly "not of this world." Both
    are distractions and, if lived in too continuously, both
    can become, in Marx's phrase, "the opium of the people"
	and so a threat to freedom. Only the vigilant can maintain
    their liberties, and only those who are constantly and
    intelligently on the spot can hope to govern themselves
    effectively by democratic procedures. A society, most of
    whose members spend a great part of their time, not on the
	spot, not here and now and in the calculable future, but
    somewhere else, in the irrelevant other worlds of sport and
    soap opera, of mythology and metaphysical fantasy, will find
    it hard to resist the encroachments of those who would
    manipulate and control it.
	In their propaganda today's dictators rely for the most
    part on repetition, suppression and rationalization - the
    repetition of catchwords which they wish to be accepted as
    true, the suppression of facts which they wish to be ignored,
    the arousal and rationalization of passions which may be
	used in the interests of the Party or the State. As the art
    and science of manipulation come to be better understood,
    the dictators of the future will doubtless learn to combine
    these techniques with the non-stop distractions which, in
    the West, are now threatening to drown in a sea of
	irrelevance the rational propaganda essential to the
    maintenance of individual liberty and the survival of
    democratic institutions.
